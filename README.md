# Smart Energy Monitoring System using ESP32

## Overview
This project is an IoT-based Smart Energy Monitoring System developed using ESP32 and ACS712 current sensor. It measures real-time energy consumption and helps users monitor power usage efficiently.

## Features
- Real-time current monitoring
- Power consumption estimation
- ESP32 based embedded system
- Serial output for debugging

## Hardware Used
- ESP32
- ACS712 Current Sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply

## Software Used
- Arduino IDE

## Working
The ESP32 reads analog values from the ACS712 sensor, calculates the current, and displays the readings on the serial monitor.

## Applications
